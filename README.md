# Coding-Skills-Project-1
A C++ queue simulation that models a ticket counter using a Circular Queue. Customers join and get served using enqueue and dequeue operations. The program displays the current queue, front and rear positions, and detects overflow and underflow. A simple menu-driven system demonstrates real queue behavior.
