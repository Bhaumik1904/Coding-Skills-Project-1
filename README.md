Overview:
This project simulates a ticket counter using a Circular Queue. Each customer receives a token number. New customers are added to the queue using enqueue and customers being served are removed using dequeue. After every operation, the updated state of the queue is displayed to help understand the internal working of a queue.

Features:
• Circular Queue implemented using an array
• Add customer (enqueue)
• Serve customer (dequeue)
• Display all waiting customers
• Show front and rear customer
• Handles queue overflow and underflow
• User-friendly menu driven program

Concepts Demonstrated:
• FIFO (First In First Out)
• Circular queue behavior using modular arithmetic
• Front and rear pointer movement
• Efficient memory usage
• Practical simulation of a real queue system

How to Run:
Compile using: g++ queue_simulation.cpp -o queue
Run using: ./queue

Time and Space Complexity:
Enqueue – O(1)
Dequeue – O(1)
Get Front / Get Rear – O(1)
Display Queue – O(n)
Space Complexity – O(n)

Conclusion:
This project gives a practical understanding of how a queue works internally using a circular array. It visualizes real queue behavior and helps beginners learn FIFO logic, pointer movement, and efficient circular memory usage.
